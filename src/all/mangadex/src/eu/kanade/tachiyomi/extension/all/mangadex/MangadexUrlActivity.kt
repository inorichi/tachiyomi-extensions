 * Springboard that accepts https://mangadex.com/title/xxx intents and redirects them to
 * the main tachiyomi process. The idea is to not install the intent filter unless
 * you have this extension installed, but still let the main tachiyomi app control
 * things.
 *
 * Main goal was to make it easier to open manga in Tachiyomi in spite of the DDoS blocking
 * the usual search screen from working.
